# DarkMatter

WARNING: VERY EARLY VERSION!! 

This code compares the H -> WW -> lvlv variables distributions with the pp -> HXX -> WWXX -> lvlvXX variables distributions.

The samples are stored on lxplus:

H->WW: /afs/cern.ch/user/n/ntrevisa/public/latinoHWW

HXX->WWXX: /afs/cern.ch/user/d/dburns/public/HWWSignalMC/

latinoDM.cpp (UNDER CONSTRUCTION!!) exploits the HXX sample variables to build latinos variables, in order to ease the comparison.

macro.C (UNDER CONSTRUCTION!!) plots the distributions of a variable in the two cases, on the same canvas.

the setups used for ROOT are contained in setup_slc6.sh
